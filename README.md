# Hi-CMFR
Codes for Hi-CMFR, a non-deep learning enhancement method for low-resolution/sparse Hi-C and scHi-C contact matrix.

Hi-CMFR uses computational methods to accomplish a framework similar to the "add noise and then denoise" concept in diffusion model, and has been proven to be effective in restoring rough structural information lost in Hi-C contact matrix due to data sparsity.

To use this tool, you must preload all the functions listed in "preload.py", and conduct Hi-CMFR in "Hi-CMFR_main.py". You may also use the ploting function and evaluation function listed in "additional.py".
